Golden Retriever
================

Simple image retriever from URLs.
This is a small project developed as a skill test required by a potential oDesk client of mine.

Golden Retriever is the simplest Django application and it  features a simple yet good looking interface thanks to the Foundation framework http://foundation.zurb.com/.
The site's behavior is coded using JQuery. 

**DEPENDENCIES**

* Django
* BeautifulSoup


Most of the code is Django 'standard' files, Foundation's CSS and the JQuery module.

Actual code writen by me:
* [`../retrieve/views.py`](goldenretriever/retrieve/views.py)
* [`../retrieve/static/js/retrieve.js`](goldenretriever/retrieve/static/js/retrieve.js)
